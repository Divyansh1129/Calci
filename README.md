Hybrid Calculator (C++)

Description

The Hybrid Calculator is a C++ program that performs both basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and scientific calculations (trigonometric functions, logarithms, exponentiation, etc.). It demonstrates the power of object-oriented programming (OOP) by utilizing inheritance and polymorphism to integrate different types of calculators into one system.

Features

✅ Basic Arithmetic Operations

Addition (+)

Subtraction (-)

Multiplication (×)

Division (÷)


✅ Scientific Calculations

Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)

Logarithmic functions (log, ln)

Exponential functions (e^x, x^y)

Square root calculation


✅ Object-Oriented Approach

Uses inheritance to combine different types of calculators

Demonstrates polymorphism for function overriding


Technologies Used

C++ (OOP concepts)

Math Library (cmath for scientific calculations)


How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/hybrid-calculator.git
cd hybrid-calculator


2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:

g++ hybrid_calculator.cpp -o calculator -lm


3. Run the executable:

./calculator



Usage

1. Choose between basic arithmetic or scientific calculations.


2. Input the required values.


3. The program will process the input and display the result.



Future Improvements

Add a Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Support for complex numbers

Implement a history feature to save calculations
